    <p>Nah idk what I'm even writing and there are already a few comments on my thingy so yeah
        idk what to say or shall I go deeper into the lore, don't read the bottom of my website pls thanks diolch mer√ßi Danke <br>
    Entry 2: So that senator that did another brainrot speech is crazy tho I can't believe that its gone that far. At least Wales is still Welsh so we're all good for now. 
        For now I literally have nothing to write apart from vibe coding sucks ass. Compsci is still relevent in the world of GPUs being used for anything but graphics, and liquid glass is more like liquid ass.
        Until my next entry, tsch√ºss, Hwyl and Cya!
